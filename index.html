                <h3>Origins<sup>1</sup></h3>
                <p>
                    In 1772, Cape Town heralded the inception of its inaugural Masonic lodge, Lodge De Goede Hoop. This
                    establishment marked the beginning of a flourishing Masonic influence. By 1812, the English Grand
                    Lodge had established the British Lodge, and by 1860, the Scottish made their presence known. The
                    1890s saw the introduction of Irish Freemasonry to South Africa. By 1898, under the leadership of
                    W.Bro. Dr. E.H. Croghan from Abercom Lodge No.159, the initiative for a Provincial Grand Lodge
                    began. Following extensive consultations with Deputy Grand Secretary V.W.Bro. H.E. Flavelle, a
                    unanimous decision was reached, leading to a formal petition to the Grand Master.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Affiliated with Abercom Lodge since 1897, R.W. Bro. Kendal Franks played an instrumental role in
                    this foundational period. An esteemed alumnus of the University of Dublin, Franks was renowned as a
                    distinguished surgeon. His relocation to South Africa, primarily for his wife's health, turned out
                    to be a boon for the region. Recognized for his valor during the tumultuous Anglo-Boer War, his
                    exemplary efforts earned him a knighthood from King Edward VII.

                <p>
                    St. Patrick's Lodge No. 199 in Cape Town exhibited reservations about the swift establishment of an
                    Irish Provincial Grand Lodge. Concerns encompassed logistical challenges due to the vast territory
                    and governance qualms. Nevertheless, with unwavering determination, Abercorn Lodge forwarded their
                    petition to Dublin by October 1898.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Abercom Lodge's Minutes showed restraint until July 1899. However, the Anglo-Boer War introduced
                    unforeseen challenges, including the untimely passing of W.Bro. E.H. Croghan. Amid these challenges,
                    R.W. Bro. Kendal Franks rose to prominence.
                    By 1904, the Grand Lodge sanctioned the 1898 petition, and R.W.Bro Kendal Franks became the first
                    Provincial Grand Master of the Provincial Grand Lodge (I.C).
                    The first Quarterly Communication of the Provincial Grand Lodge of South Africa (I.C) was held 13
                    February, 1905, at the Plein Street Masonic temple in Johannesburg.

                <p>Even before the official establishment of the Provincial Grand Lodge of Ireland, several lodges were
                    actively affiliated with the Grand Lodge of Ireland:</p>

                    Masonic organization in the region saw significant milestones with the establishment of the
                    Provincial Grand Lodge (I.C) in the Southern Cape in 1925 and in Natal in 1932.

                    R.W Bro E.W. Snell, after receiving his patent from M. W. the Grand Master, the Earl of Donoughmore,
